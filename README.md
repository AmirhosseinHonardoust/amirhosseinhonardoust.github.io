## About
   
This repository hosts my personal website, built as a lightweight, static page using plain HTML and CSS.

The site is intentionally minimal and focused on:
- clarity over decoration
- real projects over buzzwords
- systems that work outside a notebook

It highlights selected machine learning and data projects, along with short notes on how I think about evaluation, forecasting, and applied ML.
